                android:text="The velocity with which sound travels in any medium may be determined if the frequency and the wavelength are known. The relationship between these quantities is:\n
v = f位\n
Where\n
v = velocity of sound propagation\n
f = frequency\n
位 = wavelength\n
In this experiment the velocity of sound in air is to be found by using tuning forks of known frequency. The wavelength of the sound will be determined by making use of the resonance of an air column.\n\nProcedure:\n
1. Fill the tube nearly full of water. Strike one of the tuning forks with the rubber mallet supplied and hold it above the water column. Caution: do not touch the tube with the tuning fork - the rapidly moving fork can break the plastic.\n
2. Using the moveable water reservoir, lower the water surface slowly, listening for amplification of the tone. When a resonance is found, a pronounced reinforcement of the sound will be heard. Move the water surface up and down several times to locate the point of maximum sound intensity and mark that point with a rubber band on the outside of the tube.\n
3. Lower the water further to find the next resonant length. Continue in this manner as far as the length of the tube will permit. Obtain the lengths 位/4, 3位/4, etc. in meters from your measurements. You will need to check to see if your column lengths follow the progression 1, 3, 5, 7, -- since you may have missed a resonance or counted one of the fainter spurious resonances which sometimes occur. Calculate the wavelength and velocity of sound.\n
4. Repeat the procedure for the other tuning forks supplied. The velocity in miles per hour may be found by multiplying the velocity in m/sec by the factor 2.24. Please record the room temperature for reference since the velocity of sound increases with increasing air temperature.\n
